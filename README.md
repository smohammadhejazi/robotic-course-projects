# Robotics Coursse Projects     
Robotic course CEIT@AUT projects: ROS   
      
There are four project:   
- 1: Rotating and moving using odometry
- 2: Path following using PID controller
- 3: Using lidar and odometry to avoid obstacles
- 4: Using vector field histogram algorithm and slam for obstacle avoidance and reaching end goal
